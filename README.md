# safari-project

This is a cute little project I worked on with two teammates, Anika and Namika. Explore some safari sights on our three webpages dedicated to the elephant, giraffe, and lion!

Unfortunately, I have lost a bit of code. The elephant and giraffe pages are mostly intact, though the lion one is decimated. Apologies to lions.
