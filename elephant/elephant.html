                               <h3>General Information</h3>
                               <p>
                                   Elephants are fascinating creatures.
                                   They are the largest land mammals on earth with distinctly large ears and long trunks.
                                   There are two genetically different African species: the Savanna elephant and the Forest elephant.
                                   The African Savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian and African forest elephants are smaller.
                                   The African Savanna Elephants stand up to 3 meters high and weigh on average 6000 kg.
                                   Males typically reach their full size at 35-40 years. At birth, calves can weigh 120 kg.
                               </p>
                               <br>
                           </div>
                           <div class="info-section">
                               <h3>Diet</h3>
                               <p>
                                   African Elephants, as known herbivores, spend much of their days foraging and eating grass, leaves, bark, fruit, and a variety of foliage.
                                   Their diet is high in cellulose. They need to eat an average 160-300 pounds of vegetation every day and drink 20-50 gallons of water.
                                   African elephants can go several days without drinking water in dry climates.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                                   The savanna elephants are larger animals that roam sub-Saharan Africa while the forest elephants are smaller that live in forests of Central and West Africa.
                                   African Savanna Elephants are found in open and wooded savannas to even some desert and forests.
                                   On the other hand, African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests.
                               </p>

                               <h3>Survival and Reproduction</h3>
                               <p>
                                   Elephants have a complex social structure organized - one group with females and calves and another with just male elephants.
                                   One calf is born every four to five years and is taken care of by the entire herd of related females.
                                   Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal - almost 22 months!
                                   Male elephants leave the herd once they reach puberty. On average, an elephant can feed up to 18 hours.
                                   The challenge lies in the lengthy reproduction cycle of elephants.
                                   Reproduction for these large mammals are only 5-6 percent and not enough calves are being born to make up for the losses from poaching.
                               </p>
                               <br>
                           </div>
                           <div class="info-section">
                               <h3>Social Structure</h3>
                               <p>
                                   In an elephant herd, the core family unit comprises the matriarch, her calves, and grand-calves, totaling between 6 and 20 members.
                                   Female elephants typically remain with their herds for life, unlike the males.
                                   When male elephants reach puberty, usually between 12 and 15 years old, they become more independent and eventually leave their herds entirely.
                                   Afterward, they may either roam alone or join a loosely-associated group of male elephants.
                                   This behavior leads to the formation of separate female and male herds, which rarely interact except for breeding purposes.

                               <h3>Conservation</h3>
                               <p>
                                   Elephants help maintain forest and savanna ecosystems for other species and an integral part of biodiversity.
                                   They can make pathways in dense forested habitat for other animals and even a footprint can provide a home for small organisms.
                                   This is why it is important to protect elephants and provide a home and security for these endangered species.
                                   African Elephants are protected in all countries of their geographic range.
                                   Advocates have started to launch various campaigns to address the supply side (poaching) and the demand side (people who buy ivory) of the illegal trade.
                                   There's been a correlation between regions with high levels of poverty and high poaching rates.
                                   It's been suggested that helping communities develop sustainable livelihoods could lower the incentive of poaching.
