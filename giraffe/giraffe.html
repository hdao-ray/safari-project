                        <h3>General Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes hold the title of being the tallest land animals, with males (bulls) reaching heights of over 5.5 meters (18 feet), and the tallest females (cows) measuring around 4.5 meters.
                            With their prehensile tongues, which can extend nearly half a meter, they can comfortably reach foliage up to six meters high for browsing.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Diet</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes, being herbivores, primarily feed on vegetation, with a preference for leaves, twigs, and sometimes grasses, flowers, and fruits if accessible.
                            Giraffes exhibit flexibility in their eating behaviors, being able to stretch their necks to reach high leaves, graze on grass at ground level, and bend down to drink from lakes and ponds.
                            They typically graze during dawn and dusk in open areas, allowing them a clear view of trees and heightened alertness to potential threats.
                            However, when food is scarce, giraffes can adapt to different environments.
                            Given their large size, giraffes spend a considerable portion of their day eating, consuming up to 75 kilograms (about 165 pounds) of food daily.

                        <h3>Habitat</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes can be found in savannas, grasslands, or open woodlands, with a preference for areas abundant in acacia vegetation.
                            The majority of giraffes reside in East Africa, as well as in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa.
                            Historically, giraffes were also prevalent in West Africa, south of the Sahara, until the mid-20th century.
                            However, populations in this region have significantly declined and are now increasingly scattered.

                        <h3>Survival and Reproduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The gestation period lasts for 15 months, and while most calves are typically born during dry months in certain regions, births can occur at any time of the year.
                            The solitary offspring measures approximately 2 meters (6 feet) tall and weighs around 100 kg (220 pounds).
                            During the first week after birth, the mother nurtures and bonds with her calf in seclusion, through licking and nuzzling as they familiarize themselves with each other's scent.
                            Following this period, the calf joins a "nursery group" consisting of other calves of similar age, while mothers forage at varying distances.

                        <h3>Social Structure</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes exhibit a social structure known as "fission-fusion," wherein they do not consistently remain with the same group of individuals but rather change their social companions from day to day.
                            The factors influencing their social preferences vary significantly.
                            Habitat complexity, including the amount of tree or shrub coverage, and disturbance levels from factors such as tourists or predators, play a role in these preferences.
                            However, the most influential factor appears to be foraging behaviors. Adult females tend to associate with others who have similar dietary needs and prefer to consume the same types of plants.

                        <h3>Conservation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Giraffes were previously found across a large part of sub-Saharan Africa but are now encountering significant challenges to their long-term survival in the wild.
                            Given their presence in various habitats, land-use systems, and socio-political contexts, giraffes confront numerous obstacles.
                            Researchers from the Conservation Ecology Center are partnering with an expanding network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and governments of countries where giraffes reside to tackle crucial knowledge gaps and devise science-driven strategies for giraffe conservation throughout Africa.
